# Winstars AI DS internship test

## Description

This repository contains solutions for two AI/ML tasks as part of the Winstars Data Science internship test:

1. **Task 1: MNIST Image Classification with OOP**  
   Implements three different MNIST digit classification models using Object-Oriented Programming principles. Models include Random Forest, Feed-Forward Neural Network, and Convolutional Neural Network. A unified `MnistClassifier` wrapper provides a consistent interface for training and prediction.


2. **Task 2: Named Entity Recognition + Image Classification**  
   Implements a multi-modal ML pipeline combining NLP and Computer Vision to verify user-provided text descriptions of animals in images. Includes a transformer-based NER model for text, an image classifier (ResNet50), and a pipeline script for boolean verification (partially implemented).

## How to Use

### Task 1: MNIST Classification
- Navigate to `task1/`
- See `task1/README.md` for detailed instructions on training and predicting using Random Forest, Feed-Forward NN, or CNN.

### Task 2: NER + Image Classification Pipeline
- Navigate to `task2/`
- See `task2/README.md` for instructions on training the image classifier, running the NER model, and using the pipeline (partially implemented).

## Notes
- Task 1 is fully implemented with all models and unified interface.  
- Task 2 is partially implemented; image classifier and pipeline notebook exist, but full NER training and end-to-end pipeline script are still in progress.
